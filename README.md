## SecureYAC

The main goal of this application is secure messaging. With Double Ratchet protocol combined with Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol, this application offers a secure, peer-to-peer messaging platform with a clean and easy-to-use graphical user interface that does not rely on the security of third parties, such as servers or the service provider. The goal is not to obscure the fact that the two users are communicating but to secure the contents of the conversation.
