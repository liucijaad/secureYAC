## SECTION B


### Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to offer an open-source, non-profit secure messaging application. With this applicaiton, the users will be able to set up private encrypted chats over Local Area Network and exchanges messages, images and files.

### Outline

Our proposed project aims to develop a secure messaging application that allows users to communicate privately by using peer-to-peer connections, with no external server involved. The application will feature encrypted messaging, image sharing, and file transfers, ensuring that all data exchanged remains confidential and is only accessible to the intended users.

### Background

The inspiration for this project came from general interest in cybersecurity, cryptography, and privacy. With data leaks from the big companies become more common and public, data privacy concerns and the mistrust in the corporations  that offer the mainstream messaging applications, there is a need for a simple, lightweight, open-source messaging application.

### Achievements

**Target Audience**

The target audience of this project is privacy and security conscious people.

**Functionality of the Application**

With this application, the user will be able to intiate private chats, send encrypted messages, images and files.

### Justification

This messaging application is not tied to any corporation and the data of the user is stored only on their local machine. The only data that is shared is the one that the user chooses to share. While there already exist some application that offer secure encrypted messaging and file sharing features, the data usually goes through a company controlled server, where it could be stolen, stored and sold or decrypted. By eliminating the server as middle-man, we are offering additional security for Local Area Network messaging and file sharing.

### Programming language(s)

**Java:** Primary language for backend logic, message encryption and communication protocols.

**JavaFX:** For building the frontend user interface of the application.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

**Frontend**:

-   **JavaFX**: For creating the graphical user interface.

**Backend**:

-   **Java**: For handling the application logic, encryption, and message transfers.
-   **Java Sockets**: For establishing peer-to-peer connections over LAN to send and receive messages and files.

**Encryption**:

-   **Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)**: For implementing encryption and decryption algorithms to secure the communication.

**Version Control**:

-   **Git and GitLab**: For version control and collaboration.

**Testing**:

-   **JUnit**: For unit testing of backend components.

### Hardware

No special hardware/software requirements.

### Learning Challenges

* Implementation of encryption and decryption algorithms.
* Creating a user-friendly interface.
* Configuring the application to send messages, images and files through Local Area Network.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
